Introduction
============
This FAQ has been prepared by the cn.bbs.* administrative group to give an
overview of the hierarchy and with the purpose of helping news admins all
over the world to configure their news system for the cn.bbs.*
Usenet-newsgroups (also known as "cn.bbs.* hierarchy").

The cn.bbs.* hierarchy is Usenet Newsgroups that are primarily distributed
within and to do with China, a country in East Asia.  While the groups are
mainly for Chinese at home they are also exported and can be read by people
in other countries if their site gets a feed of them.
The languages used in cn.bbs.* are Simplified Chinese or English, and if you
want the majority of people to understand, you need to post in Simplified
Chinese.  Chinese fonts(GB2312) and keyboard may be needed.

A few config lines added to the configuration files ensure that the
control messages sent by the group-admin maintainer are easily
processed with a good degree of security and automation.

1. Recent changes
=================
- 10/02/2002:
  First version. Really alpha.


2. Who administers cn.bbs.*? 
============================
In May 2002, eight persons were accepted to administer the cn.bbs.*
hierarchy.  Together they are called "Administrative Group" (AG).
You can reach them at this address:
	control@cn-bbs.org

At this moment, AG consists of:
	Zhuangzhi Chen	<czz at cn-bbs dot org>
	Chenglei Peng	<pcl at cn-bbs dot org>
	Huapeng Chen	<chp at cn-bbs dot org>
	Hui Xu      	<xh at cn-bbs dot org>
	Wei Zhang  	<zw at cn-bbs dot org>
	Xiang Lv	<lx at cn-bbs dot org>
	Xiubin Qian	<qxb at cn-bbs dot org>
	Zhankao Wen	<wzk at cn-bbs dot org>
	Zhihua Huang	<hzh at cn-bbs dot org>


3. What does the AG do to administer cn.bbs.*?
==============================================
The AG takes care of sending control messages for creating (newgroup) 
and removing (rmgroup) cn.bbs.* newsgroups. Control messages issued for 
cn.bbs.* are archived at: ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/control/cn/cn.bbs.*

Discussions about new cn.bbs.* groups takes place in cn.bbs.admin
The document that describes how to create a new cn.bbs.* newsgroup will 
be posted by the AG.  A "checkgroups" control message for cn.bbs.* is 
being posted each 21st day of the month.


4. Which groups should I take on my site? 
=========================================
That is up to you to decide.  However, if you're taking a "full feed",
then you should accept the periodic control messages for the cn.bbs.*
groups issued by the AG KeyMaster (aka "control authority"), and by nobody
else.


5. How should I configure my newssite for cn.bbs.*? 
===================================================
The AG KeyMaster uses PGP to digitally sign the newgroup, rmgroup and 
checkgroups control messages.

If you are using the PGP, you can have the newsserver automatically handle
the KeyMaster control messages.

The PGP public key for the cn.bbs.* hierarchy can also be downloaded from
the following URL: http://www.cn-bbs.org/pubkey-cn.bbs.admin.announce

6. What is the configuration for moderated groups? 
==================================================
Normally, postings to a moderated newsgroup are being sent to a server that
keeps an up-to-date list of moderators.  For the cn.bbs.* hierarchy, the
server used is: moderators.isc.org

You can use:

C News (file "mailpaths")
------
cn.bbs.* %s@moderators.isc.org

INN (file "moderators")
---
cn.bbs.*:%s@moderators.isc.org

  Please use "moderators.isc.org" instead of "moderators.uu.net", 
  because an email to an cn.bbs.* moderator will only be forwarded 
  correctly through moderators.isc.org


7. Are there any other sources with useful information?
=======================================================
The following URL contains all relevant links for the cn.bbs.*
hierarchy: http://bbs.cn.news-admin.org (in different languages)


8. Where can I find an up-to-date list of cn.bbs.* newsgroups?
==============================================================
On each 21st day of the month, an actual list is being posted in 
"cn.bbs.admin.announce".  The checkgroups control message (see subject 5)
is posted there, too, but normally only shows up in the pseudo-newsgroups
"control" or "control.checkgroups".
